This directory mostly contains firmware images for the WRT1900AC Linksys router and the .config files needed to recreate them.

  openwrt-greymattr-utimate-13.img - Is an image I built with many extra packages for usb, filesystems, pentesting, and media.
  
  dot_config_mf1 - my first build .config file
  
  dot_config_mf2 - my second build .config file ( used to build the ultimate-13 image )
