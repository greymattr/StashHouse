Dual Blinky README

About: 
	dual_blinky.ino is an arduino program for controlling 2 RGB leds connected to 
  an arduino Uno, or Nano board.  Written by Matthew Fatheree for Belkin/Linksys

Hardware Configuration:
	led #1 red pin   connected to Digital pin 3
	led #1 green pin connected to Digital pin 5
	led #1 blue pin  connected to Digital pin 6
	led #2 red pin   connected to Digital pin 9
	led #2 green pin connected to Digital pin 10
	led #2 blue pin  connected to Digital pin 11
	USB to serial port set at 57600 8N1 for comminucation
	
	
Use:
	Open a terminal emulator such as putty or hyperterminal on the serial port 
	that is created when you attach the arduino unit.  The serial port settings 
	should be baud 57600 8 data bit, no parity, and 1 stop bit ( 57600 8N1 )
	
	use commands in the format below to control the behavior of the LED's
	LED Macro commands:
		Macro format:     (p)l#,<mode>(args);
		
		p  - program flag ( optional )
		l# - led no 1 or 2
		modes:
			b    = blink                              | sr = start red value   (0-255)
			args = sr,sb,sg,er,eg,eb,freq,repeat      | sg = start green value (0-255)
			                                          | sb = start blue value  (0-255)
			t    = transition                         | er = end red value     (0-255)
			args = sr,sb,sg,er,eg,eb,freq,repeat      | eg = end green value   (0-255)
			                                          | eb = end blue value    (0-255)
			+    = on color                           | freq = frequency      (0-9999)
			args = r,g,b                              | repeat = repeat        (0-255)
			
			x    = led off
			( no arguments )
	( see examples below )
			
	Special commands:
		reset    = reset programs to start state
		XXX      = clear saved configurations ( leaves running configurations )
		save     = save current programs to eeprom ( use with caution )
		sync     = sync the LED timers
		show     = show the running macros

Macro Command Examples:

Macro                           |   Explainnation
================================|===============================================
l1,+255,255,255;                |	LED 1 to RGB value 255,255,255
l1,+255,0,0;                    | LED 1 to red value 255, green 0, blue 0
l1,x;                           | LED 1 off
l2,b0,0,0,255,255,255,2000,5;   | LED 2 blink off/on every 2 seconds 5 times
l1,b0,0,0,0,0,255,1000,3;       | LED 1 blink off/blue every 1 second 3 times
l2,b255,0,0,0,255,0,3000,10;    | LED 2 blink red/green every 3 seconds 10 times
l1,t0,0,0,255,255,255,4000,0;   | LED 1 transition off/on over 4 seconds forever
l2,t255,255,255,0,0,0,2000,3;   | LED 2 transition on/off over 2 seconds 3 times

Saving Macro Programs:
	Any macro command may be prefixed with 'p' to write that LED program to EEPROM
	so it will be loaded after reboot.  
	For example, entering the command:
	pl1,b0,0,0,255,255,255,2000,5;

	will program LED1 to blink off/on every 2 seconds 5 times.  If you reboot the 
	unit, the LED should run that program after reboot.
	
	You can also save both programs by using the 'save' command
	
	You can erase saved programs using the 'XXX' command
	
	               !!!WARNING!!!
	the EEPROM has a maximum number of writes, and once it wears out, 
	saving, and loading the programs over boot will fail.  Please try to use the 
	save and erase features wisely.  	
	
Timing Notes:
  You may want to blink both LEDs at the same time and same frequency, but 
  entering the macros for each LED individually makes that difficult.  To 
  syncronize the timers on the LEDs use the sync command after programming the
  Macros.
  For Example, the commands:
  
  l1,b0,0,0,255,255,255,2000,5;
  l2,b0,0,0,255,255,255,2000,5;
  sync;
  reset;
  
  should blink both LEDs together.
